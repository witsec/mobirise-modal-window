# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v4.1 (2023-03-05)

- Added global modal block option.

## v4 (2022-08-03)

- Fixed text not using the correct font. Title and text in a modal window now use the 'text' font settings.

## v3 (2020-08-29)

- Added compatibility with themes based on Bootstrap 5 (jQuery is no longer used there)

## v2 (2020-03-14)

- Fixed compatibility with Mobirise v5

## 1.2 (2019-05-14)
- Corrected a styling issue that was introduced in Mobirise 4.10.0, which caused a modal window to be full height.

## 1.1 (2018-11-18)
- Added 'Open Automatically' to automatically open a modal window when you visit a page, with or without a delay, with or without setting a cookie
- Added feature to replace modal body (with itself...) after closing said modal, to stop active content (like videos) from continuing playback

## 1.0 (2018-11-12)
- Added 'Enable HTML' switch in params menu. When enabled, the user can enter all the HTML (s)he likes. When disabled, breaklines (`\n`) get replaced with `<br />`. This option is turned off by default, so if HTML is used with a previous version, this switch has to be turned on in order for it to work properly
- Added 'Size' in params menu. This gives the user the option to change the size of the modal window (small/medium/large)
- Added 'How to use' button that explains the user how to link to the newly created modal window. Like the 'Preview' button, this will be removed on Preview/Publish
- Added 'Learn more...' link in extension description
- Changed group to 'witsec'

## 0.3 (2018-11-05)

- Fixed modal window contents, so they don't animate (fade up) anymore, regardless of site settings

## 0.2 (2018-11-05)

- Fixed block's thumb, showing incorrect extension

## 0.1 (2018-11-05)

This is the initial release of the Modal Window extension for Mobirise.
